abstract: |
  A hands-on demonstration of lessons learned migrating from other container build tools to the RHEL container ecosystem.
  We aim to explore a set of command-line tools that are able to operate without a container daemon, and namely: Buildah, Podman, Quay and Skopeo.
  We will discuss a new set of open-source Container Management Tools starting from a hands-on demonstration.
  In a nutshell, Buildah builds, Podman runs, Skopeo transfers container images and Quay provides private and public container registries.
  Moreover, we will take a look at best practices for building images that can easily be integrated into a CI/CD Pipeline and
  vulnerability scanning with Clair, thus replacing previous build tools in workflows.
  Understand the impact of SELinux, namespaces and cgroups.
  Move from docker-compose to Podman pods.
  Build container images for OpenShift Container Platform. Develop and test Ansible Playbooks / Roles with Podman.

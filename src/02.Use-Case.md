Use Case: Team Driven End-to-End Container Build
================================================

A small development team is asked to develop an application and split the workload across operating systems / base images and development / middleware.
This is expected to grow and take advantage of secure container images build, which will be updated and maintained by the core team.

Breaking this up
----------------

- Elif is responsible for developing the secure base images and pushing them to a private registry.
- Mihai is responsible for building applications using the provided images.

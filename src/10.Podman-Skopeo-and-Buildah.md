Podman, Skopeo and Buildah
==========================

Podman Overview
---------------

### What is Podman?

![podman - manage pods, containers and OCI compliant container images](img/podman.png){ width=85% }

### How is Podman different?

- Can be run as a regular user without requiring root.
- Can manage **pods** (groups of one or more containers that operate together).
- Lets you import Kubernetes definitions using `podman play`.
- Fork-exec model instead of client-server model (containers are child processes of podman).
- Compatible with Docker, Docker Hub or any OCI compliant container implementation.

Buildah
-------

### What is Buildah?

![buildah - build container images from CLI or Dockerfiles](img/buildah.png){ width=85% }

### How is Buildah different?

- Containers can be build using simple CLI commands or shell scripts instead of Dockerfiles.
- Images can then be pushed to any container registry and can be used by any container engine, including Podman, CRI-O, and Docker.
- Buildah is also often used to securely build containers while running inside of a locked down container by a tool like Podman, OpenShift/Kubernetes or Docker.


Skopeo
------

### What is Skopeo?

![skopeo - inspect and copy containers and images between different storage](img/skopeo.png){ width=85% }

### How does Skopeo help?

- It can copy images to and from a host, as well as to other container environments and registries.
- Skopeo can inspect images from container image registries, get images and image layers, and use signatures to create and verify images.


Red Hat Image Sources Explained
-------------------------------

### Red Hat Software Collections Library (RHSCL)

- For developers that need the latest versions of tools not in the RHEL release schedule.
- Use the latest development tools without impacting RHEL.
- Available to all RHEL subscribers.

### Red Hat Container Catalog (RHCC)

- Certified, curated and texted images built on RHEL.
- Images have gone through a QA process.
- Upgraded on a regular bases to avoid security vulnerabilities.


### Quay.io

- Public / private container repository.

Universal Base Image - UBI
--------------------------

### Red Hat Universal Base Image - UBI

![UBI - Freely distributable OCI compliant secure container base images based on RHEL](img/ubi.png){ width=70% }

### How does UBI Help?

- More than just a base image, UBI provides three base images across RHEL 7 and RHEL 8: `ubi`, `ubi-minimal` and `ubi-init`
- And a set of language runtimes (ex: `nodejs, ruby`, `python`, `php`, `perl`, etc.)
- All packages in UBI come from RHEL channels and are supported on RHEL and OpenShift.
- Secure by default, maintained and supported by Red Hat.


The Red Hat Container Catalog
-----------------------------

### Certified container images from Red Hat and 3rd party vendors

### Pulling a container image

```bash
podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/python-38
```


Podman Compose
--------------

### What is podman-compose?

- An implementation of docker-compose with Podman backend.


### Why podman-compose and when to use it?

- run unmodified `docker-compose.yaml` files, rootless
- no daemon or setup required
- Only depends on `podman`, Python 3 and PyYAML.


### When NOT to use podman-compose?

- When you can use `podman pod` or `podman generate` and podman play` instead to create pods or import Kubernetes definitions.
- For single-machine development, consider [CodeReady Containers](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview)
- For multi-node clusters, check out Red Hat OpenShift, Kubernetes or [OKD](https://www.okd.io/minishift/).

Install podman, buildah and skopeo
----------------------------------

### Fedora 32 / RHEL 8

```bash
# Install podman, buildah and skopeo on Fedora 32
sudo dnf -y install podman buildah skopeo slirp4netns fuse-overlayfs
```

### Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y install podman buildah skopeo
```

### Getting help

```bash
podman version
podman --help    # list available commands
man podman-ps    # or commands like run, rm, rmi, image, build
podman info 	  # display podman system information
```

::: notes

slirp4netns is used to connect a network namespace to the internet in a rootless way.

Rootless Containers and cgroup v2
----------------------------------

### Note that our regular user has UID 1000

```
uid=1000(cmihai) gid=1000(cmihai) groups=1000(cmihai)
```

### What are UIDs mapped to inside the container?

```bash
podman unshare cat /proc/self/uid_map
```

```
         0       1000          1
         1     100000      65536
```

> UID 0 is mapped my UID (1000). UID 1 is mapped to 100000, UID 2 would map to 100001, etc. That means that a container UID of 27 would map to UID 1000026.


### Let's test this

```bash
mkdir test && podman unshare chown 27:27 test
ls -ld test
```

```
drwxrwxr-x. 2 100026 100026 4096 Sep 27 09:38 test
```
